# Bachelor's Thesis: Digital Marketing

### Note
This GitHub repository is as a supplementation for my bachelor's thesis. Additional files such as the R-Code and dictionaries used for this work can be retrieved from the Repository. Further, I created a Web Appendix using R-Markdown, including additional visualizations.  
<br />
Unfortunately, the Web Appendix is too large to be shown in GitHub, as it contains several interactive plots. It therefore has to be downloaded and opened manually.
