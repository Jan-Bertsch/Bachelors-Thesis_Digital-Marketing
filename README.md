# Bachelor's Thesis: Digital Marketing

### Note

This is my GitHub page, which is as a supplementation for my bachelor's thesis. Additional files such as the R-Code and dictionaries used for this work can be retrieved from the Repository. Further, I created a Web Appendix using R-Markdown, including additional visualizations.
