# Bachelor's Thesis: Digital Marketing

### Note:
This GitHub repository is as a supplementation for my bachelor's thesis. Additional files such as the R-Code and dictionaries used for this work can be retrieved from the repository. Furthermore, I created a html file (Interactive Plots.html) using R-Markdown, that includes additional visualizations.  
<br />
Unfortunately, this file is too large to be shown in GitHub. It therefore has to be downloaded and opened manually.
However, a simple preview version can be viewed by clicking on the following link:
